# Morphometric Analysis for Stream Order

This project performs morphometric analysis to determine stream order using Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data.

## Overview

Morphometric analysis involves the quantitative analysis of landform shapes and dimensions. This project focuses on extracting stream networks from DEM data and determining their stream order.

## Features

- Load and process DEM data
- Calculate flow direction and flow accumulation
- Extract stream networks
- Determine stream order (e.g., using Strahler method)
- Visualize the results

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- geopandas
- rasterio

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib geopandas rasterio
